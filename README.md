# Description
A fake news prediction model is a machine learning algorithm that uses natural language processing techniques to analyze and predict the likelihood of a news article being fake or misleading. The model is trained on a dataset of both real and fake news articles, and uses various features such as the language used, the tone of the article, the source of the article, and the topic being discussed to make predictions. The goal of the model is to help identify and flag potentially misleading or false information before it spreads widely, helping to combat the spread of disinformation and promote more accurate news reporting.

# Features
Language features: The language used in a news article can provide important clues to its authenticity. For example, fake news articles may use more extreme or emotional language, or may be written in a way that is intentionally confusing or misleading.

Source features: The source of a news article can also be an important predictor of its authenticity. Fake news articles may come from less reputable sources, or may be published on websites with a history of spreading misinformation.

Social media features: Social media can be a major source of fake news, and ML models may incorporate features such as the number of likes or shares a post has received, or the sentiment of comments on the post, to help identify potentially misleading content.

Topic features: Some topics are more prone to fake news and misinformation than others. ML models may use topic modeling techniques to identify the main topics being discussed in a news article, and then use this information to help identify potentially misleading content.

Structural features: The structure of a news article can also provide important clues to its authenticity. For example, fake news articles may lack a clear source or author, or may use images or video that have been manipulated or taken out of context.
